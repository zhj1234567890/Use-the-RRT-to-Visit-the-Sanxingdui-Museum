# Use-the-RRT-to-Visit-the-Sanxingdui-Museum
This is our research topic, using the RRT algorithm to visit the Sanxingdui Museum.


This is part of our research project, which aims to explore the best route to visit the Sanxingdui Museum, which is produced by Hengjia Zhang , Sihan Huang and Haoshui Tan from the G2026 Class 3 of Beijing Bayi School. We carried out a comprehensive survey on the first floor of Sanxingdui Museum, abstracted the obstacles in the floor plan into a circle with the coordinates and radius of the center of the circle, and used the RRT algorithm to plan the tour path many times.
